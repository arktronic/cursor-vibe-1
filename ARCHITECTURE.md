# BrowserHunter - MVP Architecture Document

## Overview
BrowserHunter is a 3D racer/shooter game inspired by Spy Hunter and the Excel 2000 Dev Hunter Easter Egg. Players control a car from a top-down perspective, engaging in combat while navigating through a city environment.

## Technical Stack
- **Core Engine**: Three.js (loaded directly from CDN)
- **Physics**: Ammo.js (loaded directly from CDN)
- **Audio**: Web Audio API (built-in)
- **Input**: Keyboard API (built-in)
- **Rendering**: WebGL (via Three.js)

## File Structure

└── styles.css      # Basic styling
```

## Core Components

### 1. Game Engine (`game.js`)
- Game loop implementation
- Scene management
- Input handling
- Collision detection
- Score tracking

### 2. 3D Models (`models.js`)
- Player car model
- Enemy car models
- Basic city environment
- Projectile models

### 3. User Interface (`index.html` + `styles.css`)
- Game canvas
- Score display
- Health indicator
- Basic HUD elements

## MVP Features

### Core Gameplay
1. **Player Controls**
   - Arrow keys for movement
   - Spacebar for shooting
   - Basic car physics

2. **Combat System**
   - Simple projectile shooting
   - Basic collision detection
   - Health system

3. **Environment**
   - Basic city road layout
   - Simple obstacles
   - Infinite scrolling background

### Technical Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Target 60 FPS
   - Optimized 3D models
   - Efficient collision detection

2. **Browser Support**
   - Modern browsers with WebGL support
   - Fallback message for unsupported browsers

3. **Asset Management**
   - Minimal asset loading
   - Basic error handling
   - Simple asset preloading

## Future Considerations
- Multiplayer support
- Power-ups
- Different weapon types
- More complex city layouts
- Sound effects and music
- Particle effects
- Mobile support

## Development Guidelines
1. Keep the codebase minimal and maintainable
2. Use vanilla JavaScript without build tools
3. Load dependencies directly from CDN
4. Implement basic error handling
5. Focus on core gameplay mechanics first
6. Use simple 3D models for MVP
7. Implement basic game state management

## Testing Strategy
1. Manual testing of core features
2. Basic performance testing
3. Cross-browser compatibility testing
4. Input responsiveness testing

## Deployment
- Single HTML file with embedded scripts
- Direct hosting on any web server
- No build process required
- Easy to deploy and maintain
